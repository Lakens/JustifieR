# justifieR

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of justifieR is to provide researchers with ways to justify
their alpha level. This is work in progress. All code here is an
untested alpha version that I do not recommend you use in scientific
publications yet.

## Installation

You can install the released version of justifieR from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("justifieR")
```
